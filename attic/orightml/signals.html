<h1>Signals</h1>

There is a very easy, simple, and sometimes useful method for one
process to bug another: signals.  Basically, one process can "raise" a
signal and have it delivered to another process.  The destination
process' signal handler (just a function) is invoked and the process can
handle it.

<p>
For instance, one process might want to stop another one, and this can
be done by sending the signal <tt>SIGSTOP</tt> to that process.  To
continue, the process has to receive signal <tt>SIGCONT</tt>.  How does
the process know to do this when it receives a certain signal?  Well,
many signals are predefined and the process has a default signal
handler to deal with it.

<p>
A default handler?  Yes.  Take <tt>SIGINT</tt> for example.  This is the
interrupt signal that a process receives when the user hits ^C.  The
default signal handler for <tt>SIGINT</tt> causes the process to exit!
Sound familiar?  Well, as you can imagine, you can override the
<tt>SIGINT</tt> to do whatever you want (or nothing at all!)  You could
have your process <tt>printf()</tt> "Interrupt?!  No way, Jose!" and go
about its merry business.

<p>
So now you know that you can have your process respond to just about any
signal in just about any way you want.  Naturally, there are exceptions
because otherwise it would be too easy to understand.  Take the ever
popular <tt>SIGKILL</tt>, signal #9.  Have you ever typed
<nobr>"<tt>kill -9 <i>nnnn</i></tt>"</nobr> to kill a runaway process?
You were sending it <tt>SIGKILL</tt>.  Now you might also remember that
no process can get out of a <nobr>"kill -9",</nobr> and you would be
correct.  <tt>SIGKILL</tt> is one of the signals you <i>can't</i> add
your own signal handler for.  The aforementioned <tt>SIGSTOP</tt> is
also in this category.

<p>
(Aside: you often use the Unix "kill" command without specifying a
signal to send...so what signal is it?  The answer: <tt>SIGTERM</tt>.
You can write your own handler for <tt>SIGTERM</tt> so your process
won't respond to a regular "kill", and the user must then use "kill -9"
to destroy the process.)

<p>
Are all the signals predefined?  What if you want to send a signal that
has significance that only you understand to a process?  There are two
signals that aren't reserved: <tt>SIGUSR1</tt> and <tt>SIGUSR2</tt>.
You are free to use these for whatever you want and handle them in
whatever way you choose.  (For example, my cd player program might
respond to <tt>SIGUSR1</tt> by advancing to the next track.  In this
way, I could control it from the command line by typing <nobr>"<tt>kill
-SIGUSR1 <i>nnnn</i></tt>".)</nobr>

<h2>You can't <tt>SIGKILL</tt> the President!</h2>

As you can guess the Unix "kill" command is one way to send signals to a
process.  By sheer unbelievable coincidence, there is a system call
called <tt>kill()</tt> which does the same thing.  It takes for its
argument a signal number (as defined in <tt>signal.h</tt> and a process
ID.  Also, there is a library routine called <tt>raise()</tt> which can
be used to raise a signal within the same process.

<p>
The burning question remains: how do you catch a speeding
<tt>SIGTERM</tt>?  You need to use the <tt>signal()</tt> call and pass
it a pointer to a function that is to be your signal handler.  Never
used pointers to functions?  (You must check out the <tt>qsort()</tt>
routine sometime!)  Don't worry, they're simple: if
"<tt>foo("hi!");</tt>" is a call to function <tt>foo()</tt>, then
"<tt>foo</tt>" is a pointer to that function.  You don't even have to
use the address-of operator.

<p>
Anyway, here's the <tt>signal()</tt> breakdown:

<p>
<pre>
    void (*signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int);
</pre>

<p>
What is the name of Bruce Dickinson does that mean?  Well, the basic
situation is this: we are going to pass the signal to be handled as well
as the address of the signal handler as arguments to the
<tt>signal()</tt> call.  The signal handler function that you define
takes a single <tt>int</tt> as an argument, and returns <tt>void</tt>.
Now, the <tt>signal()</tt> call returns either an error, or <i>a pointer
to the previous signal handler function</i>.  So we have the call
<tt>signal()</tt> which accepts a signal and a pointer to a handler as
arguments, and returns a pointer to the previous handler.  And the above
code is just how we declare that.

<p>
Fortunately, using it is much easier than it looks.  All you need is a
handler function that takes an <tt>int</tt> as an argument and returns
<tt>void</tt>.  Then call <tt>signal()</tt> to set it up.  Easy?  Let's
do a simple program that will handle <tt>SIGINT</tt> and stop the user
from quitting through ^C, called <tt><a href=sigint.c>sigint.c</a></tt>:

<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;errno.h&gt;
    #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

    int main(void)
    {
        void sigint_handler(int sig); /* prototype */
        char s[200];
    
                /* set up the handler */
        if (signal(SIGINT, sigint_handler) == SIG_ERR) {
            perror("signal");
            exit(1);
        }
    
        printf("Enter a string:\n");
    
        if (gets(s) == NULL)
            perror("gets");
        else 
            printf("You entered: \"%s\"\n", s);
    
        return 0;
    }
    
        /* this is the handler */
    void sigint_handler(int sig)
    {
        printf("Not this time!\n");
    }
</pre>

<p>
This program has two functions: <tt>main()</tt> which sets up the signal
handler (using the <tt>signal()</tt> call), and
<tt>sigint_handler()</tt> which is the signal handler, itself.

<p>
What happens when you run it?  If you are in the midst of entering a
string and you hit ^C, the call to <tt>gets()</tt> fails and sets the
global variable <tt>errno</tt> to 
<tt>EINTR</tt>.  Additionally, <tt>sigint_handler()</tt> is called and
does its routine, so you actually see:

<p>
<pre>
    Enter a string:
    the quick brown fox jum<b>^C</b>Not this time!
    gets: Interrupted system call
</pre>

<p>
Here's a vital tidbit of information that I neglected to mention
earlier: when the signal handler is called, the signal handler for that
particular signal is reset to the default handler!  The practical upshot
of this is that our <tt>sigint_handler()</tt> would trap ^C the first
time we hit it, but not after that.  The quick and dirty solution is to
reset the signal handler within itself like so:

<p>
<pre>
    void sigint_handler(int sig)
    {
        signal(SIGINT, sigint_handler); /* reset it to this function */
        printf("Not this time!\n");
    }
</pre>

<p>
The problem with this setup is that it introduces a race condition.  If
an interrupt occurs and the handler is called, but then a second
interrupts occurs before the first is able to reset the interrupt
handler, the default handler will be called.  Be aware that if you're
expecting lots of signals this might be an issue to watch out for.

<p>
<h2>Everything you know is wrong</h2>

<p>
The <tt>signal()</tt> system call is the historical method of setting up
signals.  The POSIX standard has defined a whole slew of new functions
for masking which signals you want to receive, checking which signals
are pending, and setting up signal handlers.  Since many of these calls
operate on groups, or <i>sets</i>, of signals, there are more functions
that deal with signal set manipulation.

<p>
In short, the new method of signal handling blows the old one away.  I
will include a description in an up-and-coming version of this document,
time permitting.
